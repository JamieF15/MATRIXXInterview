import java.util.LinkedList;

/* I have prepared a simple java class that needs completing. 
 * 
 * I compiled and run it with Java 1.8, and deliberately chose not to use the Collections classes as otherwise the problem needs to be made 
 * much more complex.
 * 
 * The class is a very basic singly linked list, with a main method that exercises it and puts output to std out. 
 * 
 * The slight wrinkle is that I want the list to remain sorted (ascending) by integer value when we do insertion and deletion, 
 * I want to use a linked list structure as it is more efficient in the use cases I am interested in, and have provided a Node class for that
 * 
 * When we talk tomorrow, you will be able to screen share to show us what you have done, so use whatever development environment 
 * you like. Feel free to ask a friend, or browse for answers, I am trying to simulate a working environment not an exam.
 * 
 * The output to std out is clearly rubbish for testing, but I want you to concentrate on building a singly linked list of integers 
 * that keeps itself sorted by value, and get those methods filled in as cleanly as you can in an hour or so. 
 * 
 * Developing a proper test harness is something we can talk about, but I donâ€™t want you to put effort into it.
 * 
 * Please have your development environment open before the interview, with the proposed changes in it, so they can be discussed
